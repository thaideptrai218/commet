## Description of main sequence
1. Visitor accesses the room search function.
2. System displays the search form with available filter options and current published listings.
3. Visitor enters or selects desired search criteria and submits the search (location, price range, amenities, availability, move-in date).
4. System checks the submitted criteria.
5. System returns the list of published room listings that match the submitted criteria.
